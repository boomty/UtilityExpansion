# Utility Expansion Mod

## Overview
Utility Expansion is a mod that seeks to add a plethora of new medieval, classical, and bronze-age weaponry and armor into the game through our immersive armor system. This mod will introduce new mechanics into the way players acquire and utilize armor that will make combat against players and entities alike more interesting. Players will now need to take into consideration what types of armor they'll bring into battle based on their intentions. Planning on fighting in the heat of battle? Bring the heaviest armor you've got. Need something that can bridge the gap between defense and mobility? No problem!
